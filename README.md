## Introduction

Laravel Sassy provides an expressive, fluent interface to [Recurly's](https://recurly.com)
subscription billing services. It handles almost all of the boilerplate subscription
billing code you are dreading writing. In addition to basic subscription management,
Sassy can handle coupons, swapping subscription, subscription "quantities",
cancellation grace periods, and even generate invoice PDFs.
